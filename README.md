# Reinforcement Learning-based Stock Trading Agent
Content:

This project implements a stock trading agent based on reinforcement learning (RL). This trading agent uses reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN (Deep Q-Network), DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), and A2C (Advantageous Participant Critic) to train agents that can trade stocks based on historical data. This simulator allows for backtesting of trained agents in real-world environments to evaluate their performance.
